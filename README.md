## Get started
Install dependencies and check to see it works. It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic installs, but `npm install` will work just as well.
```bash
$ yarn install    # Install project dependencies
$ yarn start      # Compile and launch (same as `npm start`)
```
